It is read as:\n in the type environment $TE$, the source expression $e$ is translated into a region-annotated expression $e'$, which has type $τ$, is placed in region $ρ$, and has effect $\\varphi$.\n $\\varphi$ contains the superset of regions needed to evaluate $e$.\nOne of the common misconceptions associated with regions may be that they involve allocations only on the heap. But the most common case is to have regions which only ever contain one value, called finite regions. A common optimization then is to allocate those on the stack.\nReferences References  Mads Tofte, Jean-Pierre Talpin. 1997. Region-Based Memory Management. Mads Tofte and Lars Birkedal. 1998.
