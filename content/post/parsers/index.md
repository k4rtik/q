I had a fun time writing the openQASM parser over two years ago during my two week visit at UMD College Park. Since then, I have been quite fascinated with parsers. Today, I was trying to write a parser for Lambda Q#, but I wanted to figure out if I could reduce the work I need to do and avoid boilerplate.

I found a few projects that seem helpful:
- Steffen Smolka's [Nice Parser](https://github.com/smolkaj/nice-parser) that is meant exactly for this need.
- LÃ©lio Brun's [Obelisk](https://github.com/Lelio-Brun/Obelisk), which I may end up using to generate good documentation for the grammar.

Further, since LambdaQs is based on the Modernized Algol (MA) language of Bob Harper, I somehow also stumbled upon a bunch of projects by Jon Sterling, specifically:
- [sml-modernized-algol](https://github.com/jonsterling/sml-modernized-algol), which seems like an ABT representation of PFPL. Someone also ended up contributing [a parser for the surface syntax later](https://github.com/jonsterling/sml-modernized-algol/pull/4).
- [sml-typed-abts](https://github.com/RedPRL/sml-typed-abts), an implementation of Abstract Binding Trees (ABTs). Jon seems to have [an OCaml port](https://github.com/jonsterling/ocaml-abt) too, but it seems unmaintained with a single commit.

The latter two projects will be helpful for me to translate Q# source syntax directly into PFPL-style ABTs.

Turns out what I am really looking for is [BNF Converter](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/).
